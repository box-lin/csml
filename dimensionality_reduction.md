### Principal Component Analysis

Example of using PCA to reduce data in 3 dimentional space into 2 dimentional space.

- PCA1: Find a line that crosses the central. All points that projected to this line should exhibit the maximum possible variance. This maximum variance means that PCA1 captures the largest amount of the data's overall variability or spread.

- PCA2: The line of maximum remaining variance, constrained to be orthogonal

Now to position each vector <X, Y> of data point poistion into a 2 dimentional space:
